This repository contains the high-level system design and architectural overview for **Riskwatch**, a multi-language fintech platform. The project is currently under active development.

## Project Vision

Riskwatch is designed to provide powerful risk analytics, portfolio optimization, and scenario simulation tools for novice investors and finance students. The goal is to democratize access to institutional-grade financial modeling in an intuitive, web-based platform.

### Core Features
* **Real-Time Market Data:** Stream live market data for a wide range of assets.
* **Portfolio Management:** Import and track investment portfolios from various sources.
* **Advanced Analytics:** Calculate key risk metrics like Value-at-Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, and more.
* **Backtesting Engine:** Test investment strategies against historical market data.
* **Scenario Simulation:** Run Monte Carlo simulations to forecast potential portfolio performance.
* **Portfolio Optimization:** Discover optimal asset allocations based on user-defined risk tolerance.

## High-Level Architecture

The system is designed as a set of decoupled microservices that communicate through APIs and a central message broker. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each component.



### Component Responsibilities

* **Frontend (React):** A responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) that serves as the user interface. It handles data visualization, real-time data streaming via WebSockets, and user interactions.

* **API Gateway & Real-Time Services (Go):** High-performance services written in Go handle all real-time data ingestion from market feeds. They also manage the WebSocket connections to clients for low-latency UI updates and process incoming webhooks from external services like Stripe.

* **Core Backend API (FastAPI - Python):** This service acts as the main orchestrator. It manages user authentication, portfolio CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and initiates asynchronous analytics jobs. Its strength lies in Python's rich data science and web ecosystems.

* **Asynchronous Workers (Celery & Python):** Long-running, computationally intensive tasks like backtesting or Monte Carlo simulations are offloaded to a pool of Celery workers. This ensures the main API remains responsive and allows us to scale our compute resources horizontally based on demand.

* **Quantitative Engine (C++):** For maximum performance, the core financial calculations and simulation loops are implemented in a highly-optimized C++ library. This engine is seamlessly integrated with our Python workers, giving us the performance of C++ with the flexibility of Python.

* **Message Broker (RabbitMQ):** Serves as the communication backbone for our asynchronous operations. When an analytics job is requested, the FastAPI service publishes a message to a queue, which is then picked up by a Celery worker. This decouples the API from the heavy computational work.

### Data Management Strategy

We employ a multi-database strategy to handle different types of data effectively:
* **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** Manages core structured data such as user profiles, portfolios, transactions, and historical price series.
* **Document Store (MongoDB):** Ideal for storing large, semi-structured documents, such as the detailed results from backtests or complex analytics jobs.
* **In-Memory Store (Redis):** Powers our real-time features by serving as a high-speed cache for market data and as a Pub/Sub broker for broadcasting updates to the UI.

## Project Roadmap

This project is being developed iteratively. The planned milestones are outlined below.

* **Milestone 1 (MVP):**
    * Core user authentication and portfolio management.
    * CSV portfolio import and basic dashboard visualization.
    * Real-time price streaming for a limited set of assets.
    * Foundation for asynchronous job processing.

* **Milestone 2 (V1):**
    * Integration of the C++ backtesting and Monte Carlo simulation engines.
    * Full subscription and billing integration.
    * Introduction of portfolio optimization tools.
    * Enhanced data visualization and reporting features.

* **Milestone 3 (V2 and Beyond):**
    * Expansion of supported asset classes and data providers.
    * Advanced modeling features (e.g., factor analysis).
    * Collaborative features for educational and team use.

## About This Repository

This document serves as a living blueprint for the Riskwatch platform. As the project is not yet open-source, the code is in a private repository. This public overview is intended to showcase the architectural planning and technical scope of the project.
